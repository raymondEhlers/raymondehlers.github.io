Raymond Ehlers, Physics Ph.D. Candidate, Yale University.

My major activates include:
- My thesis analysis, measuring jet-hadron correlations in pp and central Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV.
- Founder and project leader of [ALICE OVERWATCH](https://github.com/raymondEhlers/OVERWATCH), a project to monitor ALICE data quality and perform quality assurance in real-time using data from the ALICE High Level Trigger.
- Co-developer and co-maintainer of the ALICE EMCal Analysis Software
    - Co-developer of the ALICE [EMCal Corrections Framework](http://alidoc.cern.ch/AliPhysics/master/_r_e_a_d_m_eemc_corrections.html).
    - Developer of the ALICE [(EMCal) Embedding Framework](http://alidoc.cern.ch/AliPhysics/master/_r_e_a_d_m_eemc_embedding.html).
- Characterization of a ALICE TPC Upgrade alternative design which featured 2 Gas Electron Multipliers stacked on top of a MicroMegas. A paper describing these efforts was published in [Nuclear Instruments and Methods A](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2016.08.007).
- ALICE-USA Junior Ambassador.
- ALICE LEGO Train Operator.
