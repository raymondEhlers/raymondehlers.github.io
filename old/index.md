Hi! My name is Raymond Ehlers, and I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the Physics Department at Yale University. I'm a member of the [Relativistic Heavy Ion Group](http://star.physics.yale.edu/) working on the [ALICE Experiment](https://alice-collaboration.web.cern.ch/) at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland.

You can find out a bit more [about me](aboutMe.md) and my work here.
