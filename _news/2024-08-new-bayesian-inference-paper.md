title: New Bayesian inference paper!
---

I'm pleased to announce the release of our paper applying Bayesian inference to hadron and jet suppression measurements! :tada:

[This paper](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2818238) extracts the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$, incorporating all available inclusive hadron and jet yield suppression data measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC.
We systematically study the dependence of $\hat{q}$ on restricted kinematic and centrality ranges, studying the universality and validity of the underlying theory, and pointing to areas for improvement.
This is the culmination of a significant computing and analysis effort, with more results to come!

The paper is [available on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08247) and has been submitted to Physical Review C.
