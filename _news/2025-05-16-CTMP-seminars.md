title: Presented pair of virtual seminars at CTMP
---

I recently presented as part of the seminar series of the Centre for Theoretical and Mathematical Physics (CTMP) at the University of Cape Town.
I really appreciated their format, where the speaker presents two presentations over two weeks.
The first talk is an introductory seminar which is aimed at advanced undergrads and early graduate students to provide the context necessary to understand the second seminar.
Recalling my years as a student, I would have very much appreciated such an inclusive approach, especially to better understand seminars that were not in my particular subfield!

I discussed how we probe the structure of QCD matter, focusing on how we can use jet quenching measurements to disentangle the microscopic details of the quark-gluon plasma.
Since this is a theory center, I highlighted my perspective on these questions as an experimentalist since I've found such theory-experiment interactions to be highly productive.
In particular, I focused on measurements of jet substructure and the application of Bayesian inference to high momentum transfer probes of the QGP.
They kindly recorded the seminars, which I've linked below.
Please excuse my gravely voice -- between the time difference (I was presenting from California) and a cold (I nearly lost my voice before the second seminar), my voice was having a rough week :joy:

Thanks to the organizers for the invitation! It was a pleasure to present!

**Seminar 2: What can jets reveal about the microscopic structure of QCD matter?**
