title: Delivering plenary talk at Hard Probes 2024!
---

I will be giving a plenary talk at Hard Probes 2024 on Bayesian Inference in the hard sector.

I am speaking in the plenary session on Thursday morning.
[Further details will be available here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1339555/contributions/6038279/).
The slides will be posted to the indico page around the time of the talk. Edit: the slides are now posted at
the link noted above ([here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1339555/contributions/6038279/)).

I look forward to discussing this talk and new results with folks in Nagasaki!
