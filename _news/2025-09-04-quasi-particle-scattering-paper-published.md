title: Search for quasi-particle scattering with jet substructure published in PRL
---

I'm super happy to share that my paper searching for evidence of quasi-particle scattering in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) has been [published in Physical Review Letters](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.135.031901)! (also on [the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12837)).

For more information on the details of the analysis, please see [my post announcing the paper going on the arXiv](2024-09-new-jet-substructure-paper-search-quasi-particle-scattering.md). My co-author and advisor, Peter Jacobs, also wrote an [excellent high-level summary covering our experimental effort aiming to discover quasi-particle scattering in the QGP](https://nuclearscience.lbl.gov/2025/07/31/new-angles-on-jet-scattering-in-the-quark-gluon-plasma-at-rhic-and-the-lhc/). In the article, he puts my and other recent measurements into the context of the field and our current knowledge. We are rapidly closing the area where the internal structure of the QGP can hide.

It's been quite a long journey to publication! (as is often the case with experimental measurements :-) ) I originally started this analysis in early 2020 when I worked for ORNL and it has continued through my time at LBL/UC Berkeley. I'm so proud that it's finally out!
