title: Search for quasi-particle scattering with jet substructure published in PRL
---

I'm super happy to share that my paper searching for evidence of quasi-particle scattering in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) has been [published in Physical Review Letters](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.135.031901)! (also on [the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12837)).

Quoting from  [my post announcing the paper going on the arXiv](2024-09-new-jet-substructure-paper-search-quasi-particle-scattering.md),

> In this paper from the ALICE collaboration, we measure the largest relative transverse momentum splitting $$k_{\text{T,g}}$$, using proton-proton (pp) and lead-lead (Pb--Pb) collision data collected during Run 2 data.
> As partons propagate through and interact with the medium, they may rarely interact with quasi-particle excitations in the medium.
> If such interactions occur, they are predicted to enhance the number of large-$$k_{\text{T,g}}$$ splittings in Pb--Pb as compared to pp collisions.

> Experimentally, we identify this high relative transverse momentum splitting using grooming algorithms, which preferentially identify hard splittings.
> We used Soft Drop and Dynamical Grooming, with the latter employed for the first time in heavy-ion collisions.

> The measurements shows a suppression at large-$$k_{\text{T,g}}$$, consistent with the medium-induced narrowing that is observed in other angular-dependent substructure observables, in contrast to the expectation of yield enhancement due to quasi-particle scattering.
> Although the data can be described by model calculations, those which describe the data differ in the necessity of including quasi-particle scattering effects in order to do so.
> These new data therefore provide new constraints on theoretical modeling of the microscopic structure and dynamics of the quarkâ€“gluon plasma.

My co-author and advisor, Peter Jacobs, also wrote an [excellent high-level summary covering our experimental effort aiming to discover quasi-particle scattering in the QGP](https://nuclearscience.lbl.gov/2025/07/31/new-angles-on-jet-scattering-in-the-quark-gluon-plasma-at-rhic-and-the-lhc/). In the article, he puts my and other recent measurements into the context of the field and our current knowledge. We are rapidly closing the area where the internal structure of the QGP can hide.

It's been quite a long journey to publication! (as is often the case with experimental measurements :-) ) I originally started this analysis in early 2020 when I worked for ORNL and it has continued through my time at LBL/UC Berkeley. I'm so proud that it's finally out!
