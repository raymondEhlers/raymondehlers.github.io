Ever since I became a co-convener of the ALICE Jet and Hard Photon Physics working group (Jet PWG) in October 2024, we've been an extended rush to prepare for the [Quark Matter 2025 conference](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1334113/) held in Frankfurt, Germany at the start of April. It's the largest conference in our field, with nearly one thousand participants. Folks in the Jet working group put in tremendous effort to get out results for the conference! Everyone from the analyzers to the ARC reviewers to the PAG coordinators should be very proud! And for those who ran out of time to finish their analyses, don't be disheartened -- there are many opportunities to present at great conferences!

Now that we've had a bit of time to recover, I wanted to highlight the excellent work and new results from folks in the WG (including joint analyses with other WGs). We released 19 talks and posters based on results from the Jet WG! :tada: Although I was sadly unable to attend due to circumstances outside of my control, I heard all of the presentations went very well. If you'd like to learn more about each of the results, I've listed them alphabetically below[^1].

Congratulations to everyone! :tada:

[^1]: I'm very proud of all of the analyzers and I'd like to give them recognition for their efforts! However, I also don't want to violate their privacy by listing their names on unexpected websites, so I'm going to leave it to readers to click through to the Indico pages if they want to learn who presented.
